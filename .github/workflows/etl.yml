# This is mostly copied from the root lint action (lint.yml)

# It's kept separate to: 
# 1) make it easy to remove when no longer needed;
# 2) make it easy to break out into a separate repo before then if needed;
# 3) avoid any unecessary cross-package dependencies on node version; and
# 4) take advantage of parallelization due to long lint run durations
