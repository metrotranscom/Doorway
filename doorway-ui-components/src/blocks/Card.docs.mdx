# Card

<Canvas>
  <Story id="blocks-card--text-content" />
</Canvas>

The 2nd-generation Card component is intended to serve as a flexible content container with a header, optional content sections, and a footer. Over time our intention is to "port" some other card types and content blocks in the system to use Card as their underlying structure.

Styles within the Card node tree are intended to set up sensible defaults without requiring the consumer to configure bespoke styling as they author a card. For example, rule lines will be drawn automatically between the various subcomponents within a card, and margin/padding will be set according to top-level variables.

You can author a Card using subcomponents simply by referencing them via a single Card import. For example, `<Card.Header>`, `<Card.Footer>` etc. In the case where you want to create a new type of card, you can import the subcomponents directly as `<CardHeader>`, `<CardFooter>`, etc. and place them in any container. It's still recommended you include the `.card` class on your custom container so you inherit a base set of CSS properties.

Note that the `<Card.Footer>` subcomponent doesn't inherently add rules or padding so that you can use other components with self-contained styling such as `<ButtonGroup>`. However, you can add `<Card.Section>` within `<Card.Footer>` to add rules and padding.

The `<Card.Header>` subcomponent will typically be paired with a child `<HeadingGroup>` for a title + subtitle grouping, but that's not a requirement.

You can browse through the various stories for different examples of how you'd pattern a card with various subcomponents. Many of the visual aspects of a Card can be customized using the CSS variables listed below. For example, this "Detroit style" example:

<Canvas>
  <Story id="blocks-card--detroit-style" />
</Canvas>

## Card Properties

<ArgsTable of={Card} />

## Card.Header Properties

<ArgsTable of={Card.Header} />

## Card.Section Properties

<ArgsTable of={Card.Section} />

## Card.Footer Properties

<ArgsTable of={Card.Footer} />

## Theming Variables

You can apply CSS variables to the `.card` selector to customize the appearance of both the component and various subcomponents.
