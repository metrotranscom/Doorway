# ListingCard

The listing card component renders an image with optional status bars below it, and a content section associated with the image which can include titles, a table, and custom content.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="page-components-listing-card--with-tags-and-headers" />
</Canvas>

<br />
<br />

## Variants

Many of the display variations of the card are enabled by the interior content props you pass, and you can survey the various stories available to see some common arrangements. In addition:

### Stacked Tables

By setting `stackedTable` to true, the interior table component switches from `StandardTable` to `StackedTable` for a different UI presentation.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="page-components-listing-card--with-stacked-table" />
</Canvas>

## Component Properties

<ArgsTable of={ListingCard} />

**Note:** for accessbility reasons, if you have a link that should apply to the card as a whole, pass an `href` prop to the `contentHeader` key of `contentProps`. (If you previously passed `href` to `imageCardProps`, you should remove that.) You'll also want to pass `ariaHidden: true` as a prop for the footer button.

## Theming Variables

You can apply CSS variables to the `.listings-row` selector to customize the appearance of the component.
