# Deploying Bloom Services to Heroku

Bloom is designed to use a set of independently run services that provide the data and business logic processing needed by the front-end apps. While the Bloom architecture accomodates services built and operated in a variety of environments, the reference implementation includes services that can be easily run within the [Heroku PaaS environment](https://www.heroku.com/).

## Resources

- [Heroku Postgres](https://www.heroku.com/postgres)

## Heroku Buildpacks

### Monorepo Buildpack

Since the Bloom repository uses a monorepo layout, all Heroku services must use the [monorepo buildpack](https://elements.heroku.com/buildpacks/lstoll/heroku-buildpack-monorepo).

### Node.js Buildpack

Bloom's backend runs on Node.js and Heroku must be setup with [Heroku Buildpack for Node.js](https://elements.heroku.com/buildpacks/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs).
