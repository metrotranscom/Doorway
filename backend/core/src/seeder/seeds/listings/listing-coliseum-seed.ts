Applicants will not be considered to have a poor credit history when they were delinquent in rent because they were withholding rent due to substandard housing conditions in a manner consistent with local ordinance; or had a poor rent paying history clearly related to an excessive rent relative to their income, and responsible efforts were made to resolve the non-payment problem. If there is a finding of any kind which would negatively impact an application, the applicant will be notified in writing.

    "Priority Units: 3 apartments are set-aside for households eligible for the HOPWA program (Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS), which are households where a person has been medically diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. These 3 apartments also have Project-Based Section rental subsidies (tenant pays 30% of household income). 15 apartments are for those with mobility impairments and one of these units also has features for the hearing/visually impaired. Two additional apartments have features for the hearing/visually impaired. All units require eligibility requirements beyond income qualification: The waiting list will be ordered by incorporating the Alameda County preference for eligible households in which at least one member lives or works in the County. Three (3) apartments are restricted to households eligible under the HOPWA (Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS), which are households where a person has been medically diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. These apartments also receive PBV’s from OHA. For the twenty-five (25) apartments that have Project-Based Section 8 Vouchers from OHA, applicants will be called for an interview in the order according to the site-based waiting list compiled from the initial application and lotter process specifically for the PBV units.  The waiting list order for these apartments will also incorporate the local preferences required by OHA.  These preferences are: * A Residency preference (Applicants who live or work in the City of Oakland at the time of the application interview and/or applicants that lived or worked in the City of Oakland at the time of submitting their initial application and can verify their previous residency/employment at the applicant interview, qualify for this preference). * A Family preference (Applicant families with two or more persons, or a single person applicant that is 62 years of age or older, or a single person applicant with a disability, qualify for this preference). * A Veteran and active members of the military preference.  Per OHA policy, a Veteran is a person who served in the active military, naval, or air service and who was discharged or released from such service under conditions other than dishonorable. * A Homeless preference.  Applicant families who meet the McKinney-Vento Act definition of homeless qualify for this preference (see definition below). Each PBV applicant will receive one point for each preference for which it is eligible and the site-based PBV waiting list will be prioritized by the number of points applicants have from these preferences. Applicants for the PBV units must comply with OHA’s policy regarding Social Security Numbers.  The applicant and all members of the applicant’s household must disclose the complete and accurate social security number (SSN) assigned to each household member, and they must provide the documentation necessary to verify each SSN. As an EveryOne Home partner, each applicant’s individual circumstances will be evaluated, alternative forms of verification and additional information submitted by the applicant will considered, and reasonable accommodations will be provided when requested and if verified and necessary. Persons with disabilities are encouraged to apply.",
