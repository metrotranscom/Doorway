Usage: ami-chart-import path/to/FILE
WARNING: overwrites the file path/to/FILE.ts
This script takes a formatted text file and writes a .ts file containing the JSON representation
of the AMI chart data. It is expecting 9 columns, the first one being the AMI percentage and then
8 columns representing the income for a household with 1..8 people corresponding to that AMI. Ex:
20% 10,000 11,000 12,000 13,000 14,000 15,000 16,000 17,000
30% 15,000 16,000 17,000 18,000 19,000 20,000 21,000 22,000
This format is based on the PDF format for published MSHDA charts. Output note: there must be a newline
at the end of the file or the last row will not be read in.
Once you have the generated ts file, you can create a migration that uses that ts file to create the new ami chart
